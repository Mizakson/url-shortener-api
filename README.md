### Project Overview
This project is a RESTful back-end API designed to shorten URLs into unique short-codes. This service is intended for direct usage via its API endpoints. The API includes thorough collision handling and is built to be anonymous, requiring no API keys for usage. All core functionalities have been thoroughly tested using Jest and Supertest to ensure reliability and performance.

### Features
* __URL Shortening__: Converts long URLs into unique, 8-character shortcodes.
* __Redirection__: Redirects users from the shortcode URL to the original URL.
* __Collision Handling__: Automatically retries generating a new shortcode if a collision with an existing code is detected.
* __Database Integration__: Persists URL data using a database.
